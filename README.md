# ChemLogs
ChemLogs is a Research & Development project designing a system for continuously tracking EPS chemical inventory. We are working for the Chemistry department to build a database of inventory history, construct an app to view and modify it, and implement barcodes for ease of access. The project mainly involves programming and app design, which we will store in this repository.
